# extending_testing_p2_challenge
**Overview**

Find below several sections of text which outline my initial thoughts, a "play by play" of how I've tackled this problem (Log), test plan ~~(to be added)~~, and notes ~~(to be added)~~.
TLDR? Please see the latter (7th/8th) entries in the log and the bug report .md in the repo root.

**Initial thoughts**

The inclusion of both a droplist and(?)/or a droplist seems at first glance an area of concern - if given the option of either, an end user may try to have both. Will this cause conflicts? eg, both are present and contain the same information: allowlist: example, droplist: example. Is there exception handling for this eventuality? I would *expect* this to be the case and is therefore an area to test. Depending on the way the logic is coded to handle both eventualities this could lead to unexpected outcomes. If an allowlist is generated by mistake with no items but the users are intending to work from a droplist, the program may run and "finals" will be populated with nothing.

**Log**

**First Entry:** My intial thought when starting the challenge was to run the program immediately to see what it did. As soon as the program ran I realised it had modified data - I purged the repo and returned to its original state. I changed tactic and attempted to gain as much of an understanding of the application from its file structure (without looking deeply at the codebase). 

**Second Entry:** I've now created a diagram of the filestructure in an effort to better understand the applications functions.

**Third Entry:** I've added three md's (initial_events, initial_states, initial_transitions - in addition to the initial_file_structure_diagram) that set out my initial expectations of the application. This will be useful to refer back to since any deviation from the way a user expects an application to work and to how it actually functions can be jarring (dependent on the size of the variation).

**Fourth Entry:** My next step will be to manually create a small sample of scenarios to ensure I understand the functionality of the program. To reiterate - I don't intend to find bugs at this point; that isn't the aim of this step, however, if I happen across any unusual scenarios I will add my findings to the notes section below.

**Fifth Entry:** I've ran 5 sample scenarios to understand the application, one point worthy of highlighting is the time involved in creating a "clean slate" to work from since the program modifies the file structure. To this end I've written a small helper script to return the files to their default state.

**Sixth Entry:** To aid readbility I've spent a little time formatting the repo. I've also included my testplan - find it in the repos root folder.

**Seventh Entry:** Before I execute my test plan I'll write a small script to generate sample data. Should my test plan raise any issues I want to investigate further I can use this script to quickly populate the data needed to continue testing.

**Eigth Entry:** Following the test plan revealed an unexpected outcome in the first scenario - this outcome was further explored in test scenario 4 so I proceeded there; during this time I had drilled down and created further tests to verify my theories. With this in mind I did not complete the three remaining test cases due to time constraints. Given more time I would explore those tests and the ones I had listed in the test plan.



NOTES: 
On resources - within the resources directory there are two items named "clean slate" or variations there of. One is a python file and the other a directory. The python file simply purges the testing ground directory and copies the directory also named clean slate back to testing grounds. This (as the name implies) sets a repeatable, clean, test area.

On using data_gen.py and clean_slate.py: cd resources > python3 clean_slate.py > python3 data_gen.py > add generated data to allowlist or drop list manually (could automate here) > perform required testing > cd resources > python3 clean_slate.py 

This aids a clean workflow: see below for usage case
