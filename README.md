# extending_testing_p2_challenge

LOG:

First Entry: My intial thought when starting the challenge was to run the program immediately to see what it did. As soon as the program ran I realised it had modified data - I purged the repo and returned to its original state. I changed tactic and attempted to gain as much of an understanding of the application from its file structure (without looking deeply at the codebase).
